# counterpoint.ts

This repository denotes the aftermath of me
spending the weekend of the 2nd of December to attempt a first-species counterpoint bot making use of 
the [Wave Function Collapse Algorithm](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/) (WFC).

It was an exercise in seeing whether the algorithm would be a good fit for species work. Unfortunately
to me that seemed not the case. It came with a lot of challenges as the multi-faceted problem
where changing a note also changes around a lot of other things made things much more difficult.

I have achieved some natural planing in thirds and (general) avoidance of parallel notes merely by implementing
some basic rules though. Which is pretty cool in my opinion.

This is not a repository meant for actual progress nor inclusion in any other project as it's really just hacked
together in a weekend. As such, I am not attaching any license. You are welcome to view this code to see how I've tried to tackle
WFC in first species counterpoint and hopefully it has its use for other people to draw lessons from it. 
That's why I'm uploading it.

To run: ```npm install && npm start```

To test: ```npm test``` (note that the test bed has failures which I've disregarded)
